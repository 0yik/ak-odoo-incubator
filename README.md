## Branch management from v10 version

In this repo we have one branch per module.

Example for v10:

- no 10.0 branch
- branch name convention : 
  - 10-my-module : permanent stable branch
  - 10-my-module-david-...-wip : working branch
  
 - PR are done : 10-my-module-david-...-wip -> 10-my-module
 - When PR is done, 10-my-module-david-...-wip is removed
