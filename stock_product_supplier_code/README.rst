===========================
Stock Product Supplier Code
===========================

Your supplier speak its own language and you too.
But this language isn't the same: Product Reference, etc.

This module:

- Add product_supplier_code field on stock.move
- Display this field on tree view of stock.move

Generally supplier's incoming paper displays its own product code
but internal product code (Internal Reference)
is not always added on documents.

This field is useful to validate incoming picking and supplier invoice.
